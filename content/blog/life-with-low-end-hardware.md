I am nearly 28, and I have only owned two personal computers in my lifetime.

Excluding employer-provided workstations, I have had one desktop (2007-2015 to the best of my memory) and one laptop (2013-present).

The desktop had a CRT monitor, a single-core AMD Sempron processor, an 80 GB hard drive and 256 MB of RAM, later upgraded to 1.25 GB. It was my high school machine and my father's occasional taxation machine.

It came with Windows XP, which I later replaced with various Linux distributions.

While it is decommissioned and sold, I cannot thank it enough for sparking in me the curiosity about computer science, programming and open source.

The laptop is a 2013 Dell Vostro 2520, with a 15.6" 1366×768 display, a dual-core 3rd generation i5, no dedicated graphics, 4 GB of RAM and a 500 GB spinning hard drive, later upgraded to a 480 GB SSD.

It is clunky, and has some ancient tech inside it: a DVD drive, an RJ45 port, a VGA port and (by today's standards) an HDMI port. Forget Thunderbolt, it does not even have USB 3.0. There are three USB 2.0 ports, well supported even today.

I bought it with Ubuntu from the local e-commerce site Flipkart, then distrohopped for a bit before settling down with elementary OS.

This has been my primary machine for seven years and counting.

Now, this might sound like weak, barely running hardware by 2020 standards, and you won't be entirely wrong. Yet, I haven't felt the need to replace it, even though I can afford it.

Let me tell you why this machine is brilliant.

Firstly, it is economic. Adding the purchase price of ₹33,000, two screen replacements, two battery replacements and one SSD upgrade, it has cost me less than ₹65,000 in total. Fuck you, Apple.

Secondly, the keyboard is excellent. It has the right amount of travel. The keys are neither as flimsy as a Butterfly keyboard nor as hard as a mechanical keyboard. It's Goldilocks good.

Lastly, it serves all my needs without breaking a sweat. (Not that it can sweat if it tries to.)

Without the fans going off, it can:

- emulate Nintendo 3DS games at 100% speed
- run Firefox, VSCodium and a Node.js web development server simultaneously, without any lag
- compile Vala apps in seconds
- build my website in milliseconds

I realize that a lot of this is thanks to the SSD and would not have been as impressive before the upgrade, but as mentioned before, it is economic. And this is why I see no problem in sticking to it.

However, it's not all rainbows and butterflies. The device's age shows in a few areas:

- The resolution is fine, but I am spoiled by my Retina workstation.
- The touchpad is tiny. (Again, spoiled by workstation, though I can circumvent it with a mouse).
- The camera applies funky filters to your image unless you pinch the bezel.
- Some key combos don't work any more.

There's this balance of good and bad things about it, and it is inevitably approaching a tipping point where the bad outweighs the good. That being said, I believe my old buddy can pull off a few months to a year before I need an upgrade.

The bottom line is that it is okay to be conservative about hardware purchases, and quality hardware will last several years without needing a replacement.
