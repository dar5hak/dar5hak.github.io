Commuting gets a bad rap, especially in large cities. But I think the problem isn’t commuting itself; it’s the stress of manoeuvring through traffic that makes for an unpleasant experience.

I prefer to just walk. Or use public transport. It gives me the time to switch out of work mode by letting my mind wander and silencing any residual mental buzz. This turns my commute into a rejuvenating activity instead of a tiring one.

Think about it: on a bus, you can engage in anything that takes away your thoughts about work. Take a nap. Read a book. Listen to music. Do anything that helps you unwind.

This way, when you reach home, you are no longer ranting about work to your family. If you stay alone, you have more headspace for what you want to do for the rest of the day.

In my experience, this is useful even when you love your job and don’t find it stressful.

Separating your mind into two “modes” is something I have found to be super effective for my mental health.
