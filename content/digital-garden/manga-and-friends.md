This is a list of the anime I‚Äôve watched and the manga/comics/webtoons I‚Äôve read, in alphabetical order. Things to note:
- It is likely not exhaustive. I forget stuff.
- I don‚Äôt follow everything to completion. I quit when it feels like a drag. People tell me the plot anyway.

## Anime and Manga

- **_Beyblade_**  
The first season.
- **_Cardcaptors_**  
My first anime ever.
- **_Chainsaw Man_**
- **_Claymore_**  
The manga. The anime had to finish early because the manga didn‚Äôt catch up, but it was worth the time it took.
- **_Death Note_**  
Duh.
- **_Dragon Ball_**  
Till the Majin Buu arc; haven‚Äôt followed GT or Super.
- **_Elfen Lied_**
- **_Fairy Tail_**  
Till the Spriggan arc.
- **_Fullmetal Alchemist_**  
The manga, but I‚Äôve been told the _Brotherhood_ anime is awesome.
- **_Hyouka_**  
Not everyone likes this, because it never gets exciting, but that‚Äôs precisely what I appreciate: this is something you can watch to chill after all the action-packed sh≈çnen.
- **_Naruto_**  
Till the beginning of the Fourth Shinobi War.
- **_One-Punch Man_**
- **_Pok√©mon_**  
Till some point in Unova.
- **_Pok√©mon Adventures_**  
Till the FireRed/LeafGreen arc. Green is BAE. üíö
- **_Shingeki no Kyojin_**  
Till the Marley arc.
- **_Shokugeki no Soma_**  
Two seasons; will resume some day.

## Webtoons

- **_Adventures of God_**  
Short, hilarious strips.
- **_Boyfriend of the Dead_**  
Tons of geeky references.
- **_City of Dead Sorcerer_**  
Till the Jeeyul training arc.
- **_Deadlove_**
- **_The Gamer_**
- **_Internet Explorer_**  
Nothing interesting, except a personified representation of important entities in web history.
- **_Lookism_**  
High school gang wars.
- **_Weak Hero_**  
More high school gang wars.

## American Comics

- **_Batman: White Knight_** and its sequels (aka ‚ÄúMurphyverse‚Äù)  
An uncanny spin on the classic Batman world. Each story is short but not rushed. The art is impeccable. Harley Quinn‚Äôs role is oddly endearing.
- **_The Walking Dead_**  
Excellent art, storyline and dialogue. Never disappoints.
