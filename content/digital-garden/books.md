These are some of the books I’ve read and liked, grouped by category and sorted in no particular order. Excluded are the ones I’ve read but don’t recommend.

## Fiction

### Fantasy

- **_Harry Potter_**: Hands down my favourite in the genre, this is a world like none other. I’ve even reread (or relistened to in audio form) some of the books, including the Spanish translation of the first book.
  - _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_
  - _Quidditch Through the Ages_
  - _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_
- [**_Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_**](http://www.hpmor.com/): I don’t do fan fiction, but this one kills it. It challenges the way you see problems, scientific or otherwise. (To be honest, it is less fantasy and more sci-fi or psychological thriller.) Full of slapstick humour, anime references and playful stabs at the original, this doesn’t disappoint in the storyline either.
- **_The Chronicles of Narnia_**: This is for an audience younger than that of _Harry Potter_. I like the saga, with my favourites being _The Horse and His Boy_ and _The Silver Chair_. My least favourite is the finale: I wasn’t nearly as disappointed in _Game of Thrones_ as I was in _The Last Battle_.

### Crime Fiction

- By **Agatha Christie**:
  - _And Then There Were None_: Masterpiece. Highly recommended.
  - _Black Coffee_
  - _They Do It with Mirrors_
  - _N or M?_
  - _One, Two, Buckle My Shoe_
- **_The Cuckoo’s Calling_**: Rowling doesn’t do crime fiction as well as Christie, but if you like her elaborate writing style, this is a good book. I might read the other books in the series some day.

### Misc

- **_The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_ + _Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_**: I was maybe 10 when I read these, so I don’t remember much except that I liked them. Will probably revisit some time.
- **_The Casual Vacancy_**: There’s no protagonist: everybody is good and bad in their own way.
- **_The Old Man and the Sea_**: I read this less for the story and more to study Hemingway’s writing. And indeed, the writing is crisp and the story rather plain.

## Non-fiction

- By **Mark Manson**:
  - _Models_
  - _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck_
  - _Everything Is Fucked_: The most profound thing I have ever read. It digs down the evolution of human brain, and presents a framework that explains everything that has happened in history from a psychological perspective.
- _Atomic Habits_: Explains the science of habit-forming, so that you can use this understanding to build better habits and quit bad ones.
- _Indistractable_: If you read _Atomic Habits_, read this next.
- _Barking Up the Wrong Tree_
- _The Obstacle Is the Way_: A modern approach to Stoicism. Not very practical, but offers solid, time-tested wisdom on how to make the best of any situation.
- By **Cal Newport**:
  - _Digital Minimalism_: The first half is useful, actionable advice. The second half is a meandering stream of anecdotes and how they relate to the reader’s newfound leisure.
  - _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_
