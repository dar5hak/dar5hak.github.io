My name is Darshak Parikh. I am a UI developer living in India.

I write about technology, open source software and psychology among other things.

Web development caught my interest in 2015, and I havenâ€™t looked back since. I enjoy writing fast, sexy web apps and sites. I do that professionally at [CoffeeBeans Consulting](https://www.coffeebeans.io).

I also develop a bunch of [side projects](/projects), most of which are open source. I contribute to and develop apps for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/).

Besides programming, I create [pixel art](https://www.deviantart.com/blockydreams) and play retro games.
