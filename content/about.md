My name is Darshak Parikh and I primarily write about web development, Linux and open source. At other times, you will find posts about developer productivity and digital privacy.

I started taking interest in web development circa 2015, and have never looked back since. I enjoy creating blazing fast, minimal and sexy web pagesâ€”and I do that professionally at [CoffeeBeans Consulting](https://www.coffeebeans.io/).

From time to time, I also write or contribute to [elementary OS apps](https://github.com/elfenware/), or come up with [wacky APIs](http://backend.lizardspock.xyz/api/v1/swagger/index.html).

I am also an amateur [pixel artist](https://www.deviantart.com/blockydreams). I don't follow a particular style though. Expect to find [dystopian](https://www.deviantart.com/blockydreams/art/Zombie-Marshmallow-Robot-Monster-835279903), [fantastic](https://www.deviantart.com/blockydreams/art/Cinnabar-Sky-814185243), [serene](https://www.deviantart.com/blockydreams/art/Hogwarts-817488437) or [downright nerdy](https://www.deviantart.com/blockydreams/art/Rick-s-Portal-Gun-835423405) imagery.

Besides programming and pixel art, I explore world music, play retro games or read books. Yes, I still think the Super Nintendo and the Game Boy Advance are some of the best consoles ever made.

If you want to talk about these or any other topics, hit me up at darshak at proton mail dawt com.
